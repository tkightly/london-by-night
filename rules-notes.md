# Rules aide memoire

## Combat Suggestions

* give each player playing card from 1-13 as their initiative
  * shuffle every round (if I remember)
* give each player an index card, upon which they will write their character's action in general terms (i.e. attack character X, dodge, move to X)
* when that players action comes around, they reveal what their character's action will be

## Difficulty reminders

| Difficulty of action | Difficulty number |
| -------------------- | -----------------  |
| Routine (striking a stationary target, convincing a loyal friend to help | 1 success |
| Straightforward (intimidating a weakling) | 2 successes |
| Moderate (Replacing a car's sound system, walking a tightrope) | 3 successes |
| Challenging (Locating the source of a whisper, creating a memorable piece of art | 4 successes |
| Hard (convinving a police officer this isn't your cocaine, rebuilding a car's engine | 5 successes |
| Very hard (Running across a tightrope while under fire, calming a hostile and violent mob) | 6 successes |
| Nearly impossible (finding one specific homeless person in LA in one night, flawlessly reciting a long text in a language you don't speak | 7+ successes |

## Willpower Rerolls

* Characters may spend 1 point of willpower to re-roll up to 3 regular dice on any one skill or attribute roll, including involving disciplines
* cannot reroll Hunger dice or a tracker roll such as Willpower or Humanity
* A spent point of Willpower counts as having sustained a lovel of superficial damage to willpower

## Blush of Life

* Rouse Check

## Blood Surge

* add their blood surge value on character sheet to a single dice roll

## Vampiric Mending

### Superficial Damage

* Mend damage equal to the 'Mend Amount' value on character sheet

* Uses 1 turn (when in combat)

### Aggravated Damage

* At nightfall
  * make 3 rouse checks (in addition to the one from waking...)
  * Removes 1 aggravated damage and one crippling injury

## Frenzy

### To resist

* Roll willpower + one third of humanity against difficulty set by Storyteller
* on success, they resist frenzy
* players can't use Blood Surge but they can do willpower rerolls
* players don't replace vampire dice with blood dice

### While in frenzy

* Riding the wave - player retains some control of character
* If not riding the wave - Storyteller gains complete control
* Remain immune to health-based penalties
* Can only use physical disciplines
* Resist mental disciplines with x3 extra dice (if no resist roll required, add +2 to difficulty)
* The player can spend x1 point of willpower to assume control of character for a single turn

## The Six Traditions â€“ *Vampire: The Masquerade*

## 1. The First Tradition: The Masquerade
>
> "Thou shalt not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood. Doing so shall renounce thy claims of Blood."

Vampires must hide their existence from mortals. Violating this law threatens all Kindred and is punished severely.

---

## 2. The Second Tradition: The Domain
>
> "Thy domain is thine own concern. All others owe thee respect while in it. None may challenge thy word in thy domain."

A vampire controls their own territory. Visitors must respect the authority of the domain's ruler.

---

## 3. The Third Tradition: The Progeny
>
> "Thou shalt only sire another with the permission of thine elder. If thou createst another without thine elderâ€™s leave, both thou and thy progeny shall be slain."

You need permission to create (Embrace) another vampire. Unauthorized siring is a grave offense.

---

## 4. The Fourth Tradition: The Accounting
>
> "Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy progeny shall be released, thou shalt command them in all things. Their sins are thine to endure."

A sire is responsible for their childe until they are officially released into Kindred society.

---

## 5. The Fifth Tradition: Hospitality
>
> "Honor one anotherâ€™s domain. When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shalt present thyself to the one who ruleth there. Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing."

When entering anotherâ€™s domain, you must present yourself to the local authority (usually a Prince).

---

## 6. The Sixth Tradition: Destruction
>
> "Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind. The right of destruction belongeth only to thine elder. Only the eldest among thee shall call the Blood Hunt."

You may not kill another Kindred without permission. Only elders can sanction destruction, often through a Blood Hunt.

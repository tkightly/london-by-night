# The Church

## Scene 1

* Druisilla arrives home
* notices the answering machine is blinking

* Recorded message plays on request, Druisilla immediately recognises the voice, which is **Lilibet**, Druisilla's sister

> [message left  **today** at **8PM**]
>
> Hi, Drew, it's Lili. I know we haven't spoken in a bit, but I saw you walking down the street the other day with some weirdos I didn't recognise, it was like something out a movie. Thought I should call, see if things are OK.
>
> Anyway, thought I should tell you I've been going to some new kind of... church I guess you'd call it, it's not like the others though. There's about 15 of us, a mix of ages..
>
> I really feel connected to everyone, even though I've only been twice! Anyway, Father Caldus says he's going to make me a formal member tonight! Can't wait!
>
> [end of message]

## Scene 2

* Players might need to locate where this church meets

### Ideas on locating

* Visit her flat in Soho
  * does Druisilla have a key? doubtful, most likely have to break in
  * a flyer attached to the fridge mentions a gathering for "Souls Struggling with Guilt" at "St Jude's Hollow", a park/green space on the border of Islington and Camden. *Streetwise @ diff 2* will find it
  * a calendar on the wall indicates a meeting with a therapist
  * boxes of vitamins
  * a magazine on health open on an article about how to stop feeling tired all the time

* Use Contacts or Disciplines
  Streetwise/Contacts: Ask around in the occult, nightlife, or Anarch scene. Someone may have heard about the cult recruiting.

  Auspex: A player using Premonition or Scry the Soul on the answering machine could see fleeting images of the church hall, banners, blood bowls, etc.

  Dominate: Interrogate someone close to Lilibet (a roommate, coworker, etc.).

## Scene 3

* Druisilla & friends will visit the Church presumably to see what's happening with Lili

* The park itself is icy cold, freezing in fact. There is a community center on the park that looks like it might have been a sports pavilian once
* Visually, the Church seems to be nondescript. In fact, it seems like a community center that has been hired out for the night. It's on the ground floor,

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exterior | Wooden front door, peeling paint, graffiti sprayed on the outside. *Wits + Awareness @ diff 2* reveals spiral is behind some of the gang tags |
| Front entrance | Hallway with lino flooring, posters are on noticeboards advertising various community events or sporting fixtures |
| Main hall | Laminate flooring, tables and chairs are stacked up against one wall, a huge hole is in the floor that goes down about 4 meters. Next to it is a gurney, angled so that any fluids drain into the hole |

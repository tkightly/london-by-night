## Appearance

Compact and muscular with a fighter's build, Vera has short-cropped auburn hair with bleached tips and multiple ear piercings. Her knuckles are perpetually scarred, and she has a jagged scar running from her left temple to her jaw from a broken bottle in her mortal days. She dresses in worn leather, ripped jeans, and steel-toed boots. Her eyes flash amber when her Beast stirs.

## Personality

Vera is aggressive, impulsive, and fiercely independent. She trusts her instincts over reason and prefers action to planning. Years of fighting have made her quick to resort to violence, but she has a grudging respect for those who can match her in combat. She's loyal to the few she considers friends but has little patience for weakness or hesitation.

## Beast Features

From frequent frenzies and her violent nature, Vera has developed:

- **Distinctive Eyes:** Her eyes permanently have an amber, predatory gleam
- **Claws:** Her fingernails are thick and claw-like even in human form

## Combat Tactics

Vera fights dirty and without mercy. She opens with Celerity-enhanced strikes, aiming for vital spots or attempting grapples. She uses her Protean abilities tactically - Eyes of the Beast for night fighting, Weight of the Feather for mobility. If outmatched, she'll shift to animal form to escape and regroup. She's not above using the environment as a weapon or targeting a foe's allies to gain psychological advantage.

## Plot Hooks

- Rival fighter challenging the coterie's territory or reputation
- Potential recruit who needs to prove herself worthy
- Witness to a Masquerade breach who must be dealt with
- Gun-for-hire available for dangerous jobs
- Former lover/enemy of another Kindred seeking revenge

## Feeding

Vera feeds opportunistically - muggers, abusive partners, corrupt cops. She's not particularly careful about the Masquerade and has had a few close calls. She prefers to feed after a fight when her blood is already up.

## Coterie Potential

While initially hostile or suspicious, Vera can become a valuable ally if the coterie proves their strength and earns her respect. She works well as:

- **Antagonist:** Territorial dispute or hired muscle for an enemy
- **Rival:** Another predator competing for the same resources
- **Reluctant Ally:** Someone who can be convinced to help for the right price
- **Recruit:** Potential coterie member who needs to be tested first

## Roleplay Notes

- Speaks with profanity-laced street slang
- Constantly assesses others for threat level and weaknesses
- Fidgets when forced to sit still for long periods
- Respects strength and despises perceived weakness
- Has a soft spot for underdogs and victims of abuse
- Quick to anger but also quick to forgive if respect is shown

## Challenge Rating

Designed to be a serious threat to 2 beginning player characters:

- High physical attributes make her dangerous in direct combat
- Multiple combat disciplines provide tactical options
- Street fighting experience means she fights smart and dirty
- Low generation limits her raw power but skills and tactics compensate
- Can serve as either a tough but beatable opponent or a dangerous recurring threat

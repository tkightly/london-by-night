# Not a confession - Francis Thorne's Quest

## Scene 1

Francis is at the Cathedral, either in the confession booth or perhaps otherwise in the church.

- moonlight pours in through the high stained-glass windows, bathing the pews on one side in ethereal raindow-coloured light, leaving no need for other lighting
- Francis hears the sound of quiet footsteps on the flagstones
- when he looks, he sees nothing
- when he turns on his *ghostvision* he will be able to see a woman, late thirties
  - She clearly notices Francis but appears to see straight through him as though she expects not to be seen

Assuming Francis says nothing

- She will kneel before the altar and begin to pray out loud

> God…
> I don’t know if You can hear me now. I’m not even sure what I am anymore.
>
> But my son is sick. And I can’t help him. He’s weak, he’s getting worse, and I can’t even hold him.
>
> His father’s trying, he’s doing everything he can — I see that. But the man he keeps taking him to… something’s wrong. I don’t trust him. He talks too smooth, and nothing’s working. He must be expensive, I don't know how Tom can afford it
>
> Please, make him see it. Make him stop before it’s too late. I can’t do anything but watch, and it’s killing me all over again.
>
> Just — help them. Please.

## Scene 2

## Scene 3

## Supplementary information

- Jake (child) suffers with epilepsy. There is no current treatment to *fix* it but it is manageable and understandable why you would look for a fix.
- Tom is not aware that Mara is a ghost
- The doctor

### Characters

#### Jake

The sick child, around 8 or 9. Small, dark eyes darting around, highly anxious

#### Tom

The father. Late 30s or early 40s. A laborer, worn down, trying to hold things together. He’s desperate and clings to the belief that this private doctor can fix his son. Emotionally shut down, slow to anger, but on the edge.

#### Mara

The mother, now a ghost. Died of illness a year or two earlier. Still present in the house — not in a haunting way, but in quiet moments, in the corners. She’s worried, helpless, and starting to suspect the doctor is dangerous.

#### Dr. Lyle Carter

The "private doctor" Well-dressed, overly confident, charming in a way that feels practiced. Claims he can help Jake with “special treatments” but offers no real results. Something feels off about him — too smooth, too detached. Probably because he's a vampire

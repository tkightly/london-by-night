# The Retirement Party

* Sal's buddy Reggie Blaine retired recently from being a **master thief**.
* Reggie is holding a bit of Retirement Gathering, his buddy Yates offered to host and a dozen or so of Reggie's mates from around will come and play some music, bring some beers and have a bit of a sendoff for Reggie
* Most of the attendees will be young-ish, since many of the people Reggie's age will be behind bars by that point!
* Reggie will introduce Sal to George and Keith, who are young-ish lads whi are initially smiley and friendly, but as soon as they get a good lol at Sal they are cold with a kind of hungry expression
* The idea is, everyone is a little bit light-fingered or at least a bit of a lad, and they broke into the house and party there. Then at the end, everyone will take a thing or two and give it to Reggie as a retirement gift
* While there, George abd Keith will approach Sal when things are a bit quiter. they will turn to him and their eyes will burn with hunger. they will say:

>
> Your blood will nourish his veins. He will consume the earth

* Then they will attack Sal, with the intention to kidnap him to bring to the Church for sacrifice

# The Retirement Party

* Sal's buddy Reggie Blaine retired recently from being a **master thief**.
* Reggie is holding a bit of Retirement Gathering, his buddy Yates offered to host and a dozen or so of Reggie's mates from around will come and play some music, bring some beers and have a bit of a sendoff for Reggie
* Most of the attendees will be young-ish, since many of the people Reggie's age will be behind bars by that point!
* The idea is, everyone is a little bit light-fingered or at least a bit of a lad, and they broke into the house and party there. Then at the end, everyone will take a thing or two and give it to Reggie as a  retirement gift
* While there, two of the lads in the kitchen begin to go into a bit of a trance (maybe there's some trance music playing)
  * they begin to sway and then everything goes silent as everytime turns to watch
  * then their eyes turn completely black and go still 
  * one them them takes knife from the counter and slahes the throat of the other, who drops to the floor with a happy smile on his face
  * the one with the knife says in a deep, otherworldly voice "The blood must flow"
  * Sal or someone will notice that one of the lads is filming it on camcorder

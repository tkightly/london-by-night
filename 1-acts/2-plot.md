# The Plot

## Setup
* Ancient Lovecraftian entity wakes up in catacombs in Camden
* It calls out, a Malkavian elder (who it turns out is actually [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md), dreams of the entity and seeks to find him
* During the search, the elder grows the cult to 10 members, consisting of homeless people, a couple of his ghouls and some neonates?
* After 1 month, the elder finds the tomb of the entity and begins to sacrifice cult members to it (for their vitae), but realises he needs to massively increase the population of the cult as the entity demands more and more blood
* The elder decides that the Anarch population would be easily swayed with promises of a powerful ally that could overthrough the Camarilla and begins talks to bring them on board

## Act 1

* Ancient entity is stirring
* Father Caldus recruits 10 followers, all mortals (currently) that willingly give blood
* Camarilla became aware because of:
  - Whispers in the dark of 'Cain's Angel'
  - Dreams of the 'Red Beneath' (visions of the thames filling with blood) reported by [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md), Malkavian Primogen
  - Recently, an abandoned underground station was discovered by a Nosferatu informant, full of clues
* [Gregory Shaw](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md) asks the players to investigate

# Act 1

## Scene 1

| location | time |
| ---------------------------- | ------ |
| Each player character's haven | ~1900 |

* rouse the blood for waking

* players can describe their havens?

* Players will have received a note through the door of their haven during the day while they slept, requesting their presence at an address in Mayfair near Grosvenor Square.
  * Which is the Tremere Chantry to talk to [Seneschal Gregory Shaw](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md)
    * players may roll `Intelligence + Ettiquette` to see if they remember who this is
  * note reads:

    >Dear `name`,
    >The Primogen has requested your presence at the below address at 8 o'clock sharp on Wednesday 8th December.
    >My manservant Mr Crane will allow you in and take care of you. Please do not be alarmed by him.
    >Do not discuss this matter with anyone prior to your arrival.
    >Yours sincerely,
    >Gregory Shaw, PhD

  * Perhaps Julianna will have received a call from her Sire?

## Scene 2

| location | notes | time |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| Tremere Chantry |  | ~1900 |
|   * entrace hall | Furnished with marble and mahogany| |
|   * reception lounge | Soft beige carpet, chesterfields, bookshelves | |

* The weather is chilly with drizzle
  * Upon arrival, they find:
    * the address is a largish red brick townhouse, unremarkable because the street seems to be full of them
    * the street outside is mildly busy with people hurrying with coats, otherwise mostly empty

* Characters will be welcomed by his ghoul, [Elias Crane](../3-characters/ghoul-elias-crane)
  * Mr Crane should be a bit snivelly, spend a lot of time looking at vampires wrists and being overly fawning
  * Julianna will be welcomed back?

* After all characters have arrived, [Gregory Shaw](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md) will shuffle in

## Conversation

* thanks for coming
* the Camarilla is offering you the opportunity to prove your loyalty
* of late, the Camarilla has received some disturbing signals
  * [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md), who you of course will remember is the Malkavian Primogen member, has reported receiving disturbing visions and dreams
    * such as dreams of whispers in the dark of `Cain's Angel`
    * and has reportedly received a dream of what he calls the `Red Beneath`, which he says is a vision of the Thames filling with blood
  * of course Malkavians are known to receive visions from time to time, many of them never coming to fruition... [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md) has also never been particularly reliable
* but in this case, there has also been the matter of the ...uh... findings at the old [Hurdwick Underground Station](../2-locations/hurdwick-underground-station.md)
  * Our Nosferatu scouts were looking for Black Jack hideouts and they came across a rather nasty site of.. shall we say **worship**?
  * They were not overly concerned, certainly little in the underground system would spook a Nosferatu, but they did report it. Sadly, they were disturbed by human activity - probably homeless - at the site and did not get the opportunity for a good look around.
* this is where you come in. The station is only one stop south on the Northern line from Camden Town, close enough to Black Jack territory to cause trouble.
  * Which is why the Camarilla will not be sending any of the usual suspects to investigate... the Primogen has instructed me to find fresh blood for the task that will not be obviously on Camarilla duty and will provide a level of plausible deniability
  * Of course i mention this to you only in the interest of full transparency
* Your task is to:
  * investigate the site
  * find out who is responsible, whether Black Jack or Camarilla
  * ideally don't interact with the Black Jacks. If it can't be avoided, at least don't start a war...
  * above all... adhere to the Masquerade
  * report your findings directly to me. The primogen is anxious to find out if this is something to be concerned with or if they can get back to figuring out how to reclaim the stolen territory.

## Scene 3

* Presumably players will go to investigate the [Hurdwick Underground Station](../2-locations/hurdwick-underground-station.md)

## Outside

* the odd Kine walks past the station, coat collars turned up against the drizzle, their eyes glancing from building to building, but barely seeing
  * they do hurry when they need to move past the PCs
* the station itself is concrete, the front entrance boarded up with plywood
* on either side is a barbers and a pet shop, there's also a bus shelter, off licence and what looks like flats along the rest of the street

> Toreador Clan reaction:
>
> * how does your character react to something so devoid of art?

### Getting inside

* pry open plywood
* look for a way onto the roof
  * soaring leap?
  * find a way to climb?
  * go up throught the adjacent properties?
  * then go through air con units/air vents?

## Lobby/ticket hall

* some of the turnstiles are seized, some are gone, perhaps for scrap metal
* all of the ticket machines are pried open, rolls of blank tickets spill across the floor among a few copper coins
* lights are off, some hang bv the cables
* glass panels in the ceiling bring some light from outside in, but the glass is broken and rain is coming through, rusting the turnstiles away slowly
* phone booths are smashed open (no dial tone)

-> North platform (via stairs)
-> South platform (via stairs)

## Scene 4

## South platform

As you come down the stairs...

* very dark
* water is tricking down the stairs and beginning to pool in the tracks
* you hear whispers
  * **worship him**
  * **love him**

Then at the platform

* the whispers stop
* You see an inverted wooden crucifix, easily large enough to tie someone to.
  * It's lying down beside a bench and the extremities are stained with fresh blood. A blood trail leads into the **South Tunnels**
  * A symbol is etched with a crude knife, in the form of a intricate spiral (intelligent + occult difficulty 3 to identify as associated with an entity of some kind that is ancient. 5 successes will grant you the name **Nyog’Sothael, the Heart Beneath**)
* you slowly creep along the platform
* the whispers start again, louder this time, until eventually...
* As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you realise that there are dozens of tiny, tiny lights a few inches above the floor
* the whispers stop

### Encounter

* the eyes wait to see what the players do
  * if the players pretend not to see, they do nothing
  * if the PCs attack or fun, they attack
* use [character sheet](./character-sheets.md), use characters Scratch and Gnash

> if it looks like it's going bad, an underground train will come through the station very fast and spook the rats

-> Lobby/ticket hall
-> North platform
-> South tunnels

## South tunnels

* tunnel has some patchy emergency lighting
* power cables sway from the movement of a recent train
* blood trail leads into a maintenance door in the wall the leads to **Makeshift Shrine**

-> South Platform
-> Ancient Shrine

## Scene 5

## Makeshift Shrine

A converted maintenance room.

* The walls have been roughly scraped and scratched with the same intricate spiral as on the cross using charcoal and blood
* A faint reek of rot and incense clings to the air.
* It feels wrongly silent, as if sound itself is afraid to remain.

An altar has been constructed in the center of the room

* A stack of bricks and rebar, acting as a makeshift altar.
* A rusted meat hook hangs above it, still slick with blood.
* Beside it: a glass jar full of teeth, human and animal mixed.

Anyone who gets close to the altar:

> You hear whispers in an unknown language
> (Intelligence + Academics to translate, difficulty 4) **OR Auspex Vision, below**
> "The spiral drinks, but is never full."

OR

> Auspex Vision (if something has auspex...(
> “The spiral drinks, but is never full.”
> Vision: A stone altar seen through blurred eyes, blood cascading over its sides, vanishing into cracks. No matter how much pours, the stone remains parched.

* after the players knock down the shrine:

> Players hear speech in an unknown language, in a deep, inhuman voice
> "Zar'khal vethunei, kha'morai Caini. Vithruk na'zaar sil'theka, eth gharral vorrth venakai sha'veth."
> as it is spoken, it is carved into the concrete of the wall in front of them. After a few seconds, it begins to fade, slowly
> (Intelligence + Academics to translate, difficulty 4. Anybody with Auspex - difficulty 2 instead)
> "I see you, Children of Caine. Your vitae shall sate my flesh, and I shall savour the taste of your bloodline with delight."

Players will presumably want to exit the station not long after seeing that

## Scene 6 - Encounter - Bob & Barry

* upon reaching the lobby again, players will see blue flashing lights from the street, and hear some voices on the other side of the plywood covering the doors

> 1 - what's going on here then
> 2 - some kind of break-in reported
> 1 - we get them here all the time, it's just teenagers innit? They love to break in and make a mess, that's all
> 2 - but it's not safe in there, we can't just leave without at least having a gander
> 1 - all right then mate

Then without further ado, torchlight beams through the lobby

* see [character sheets](./character-sheets.md)

# Dr. Lucille Fairfax

## Basic Info

**Clan**: Malkavian
**Generation**: 9th
**Sire**: Dr. Heinrich Weiss (Final Death, 1943)
**Embraced**: 1925 (Age 32)
**Apparent Age**: Early 30s
**Sect**: Nominally Camarilla (operates independently)

Dr. Lucille Fairfax is a brilliant psychiatrist whose research into collective unconscious and mass hysteria caught the attention of her Malkavian sire during the rise of fascism in Europe. Now she operates from the shadows, using her ghoul Father Caldus and the Church of Eternal Night to conduct social experiments on a grand scale.

## Concept

A former psychiatrist turned puppet master, Dr. Fairfax uses her understanding of human psychology and Malkavian insight to orchestrate mass delusions and social movements. She sees mortals as test subjects in her grand experiment to understand the collective madness that grips humanity. Her "Herald" is both her delusion and her greatest creation—a shared psychosis that binds her followers.

- She can sense the emotional states of large groups, but interprets this through her delusion
- Sometimes speaks as if the Herald is speaking through her

# Killing the Lili - Part 2

## Scene 3

* Druisilla will arrive first, since she left without everyone else. Perhaps she arrives early
* The rest of the part  will visit the Church presumably to see what's happening with Lili afterwards

### The Park

* The park itself is icy cold, freezing in fact. The park is dense with cypress trees, there is a track that runs through the middle with a couple of interesections
* There is nobody to be seen. You might have seen some passersby on the way, but there is nobody accidentally walking through the park. It seems deadly still - no wildlife, no wind
* Voices can be heard towards the center, a chanting in an alien language
* The center of the park is a small clearing
  * *Wits + observation @ 3* - the clearing is kind of spiral-shape
  * The entrace to the clearing will be "guarded" by a [gangrel vampire, vera](./vera.md)

### Maps

##### Map 1 Item 1

##### Map 1 Item 2

* An opening in the fence, intended to allow passage through the park.
* Immediately outside of the park where the gateway is, a young person wearing dark clothing in hunched over, panting heavily
  * if questioned...
    * "blimming heck, don't go into the trees! Some super weird shit is going on, i was just walking through to get home, minding my own business... first this lady appears almost out of nowhere, i thought for a second she had orange eyes and then... I dunno i must have imagined it. Then all this chanting kind of started, in some funny language"

##### Map 1 Item 3

* A collapsed part of the wall, climbable

##### Map 1 Item 4

####### Drew arrives

* Vera will ask Drew "are you looking for you sister? Yeah shes right in here, in you go, she's waiting for you love", type thing

##### Map 2 Item 5

* A clearing in the trees

* A group of 7 people, sat on the ground like school children. Their eyes have a glazed, milky appearance, as though they are not quite present

### Enter Drew

* [Father Caldus](../../Characters/ghoul-father-caldus.md) is stood with a dripping sacrificial dagger, and will greet Drew, thanking her for her remarkable vision showed by feeding **Nyogâ€™Sothael, the Heart Beneath**
* Caldus will make Drew an offer - Sacrifice herself and Caldus will let Lili go, or Caldus will drain Lili of her blood and you can walk away with the "Empty vessel, to be filled with Cain's Curse"

# The Wolfe Street Party

* Hugo will get asked by his sire (Wilhelm von Bloom) to attend a party that night to celebrate a huge surge in the number of investors at the company
* Mr von Bloom will ask Hugo to bring a friend they can all enjoy along with them (clearly he wants him to bring some tribute in the form of someone they can drink the blood from, and Hugo will have the job of disposing of them)

* The party will be at the penthouse suite of the office building in Canary Wharf. It's big-ish but not huge, it has a open-plan layout and a modern design with mostly all glass walls facing the city

* Joe Takagi - von Bloom will ask Hugo to bring him to him coked up, Hugo will need to try and persuade him to take them. Then von Bloom will feed and will invite Hugo to join if he wishes

* In the meeting room, there will be charts on easels around the room showing the increase or decrease in value or certain stocks or shares. on each, a particular portion of each chart is highlighted and annotated showing the company's insight into the reason fro growth etc. The annotation is done on a clear plastic OHP sheet, so that it can be removed. Something about it gives you the heeby jeebies
  * **Intelligence/Wits + Finance (diff 2)** - you will see that when all the clear plastic sheets are combined, the lines drawn on them form a spiky circle. You see a flash of the Thames but filled with blood instead and take one point of superficial willpower damage

- Sirens will begin to sound
- Players could meet with Gregory Shaw who would thank them for perhaps saving London or indeed the world

- Immediately something is wrong
- A fog rises from the ground
- The spiral in the sky extends to the horizon in all directions
- Screams begin to sound
- If PCs investigate:
  - People run out of houses, screaming, blood running out of their eyes, some are violent and kill others with anything they can lay their hands on
  - The banks of the thames swell, and the Thames overflows, and it's a deep, dark, bloody red

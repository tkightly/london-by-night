### Nosferatu

- Dierdre can go and see the Nosferatu
  - they are based at Nightward Technologies, a small shop in Brent, hidden down a back alley
  - Run by x2 Nosferatu:

  ```character
  Milo "Grin" Vask
  Clan: Nosferatu
  Sire: Unknown (allegedly left him in the sewers)
  Generation: 11th
  Concept: Disinformation Artist & Social Engineer
  Predator Type: Alleycat (but with a hacker twist)

  Grin got his nickname from his permanent rictus smile—his lips torn back to expose too many teeth, like a ghoul playing at being friendly. He's the public-facing face of the company (as much as a Nosferatu can be). Grin is a deep web legend, a troll before trolling was cool. If it exists online, he can find it, manipulate it, or bury it under a thousand burner accounts.

  Where his partner handles the hardware and shadows, Grin rules the information space. He sees surveillance as both control and art. If you're being watched, Grin wants to know why—and profit from it.

  Agatha “Mother Wire” Croy
  Clan: Nosferatu
  Sire: Mr. No Eyes
  Generation: 10th
  Concept: Surveillance Engineer & Urban Crypt-Keeper
  Predator Type: Osiris (with a cult-like group of mortal tech junkies)
  
  Description:
  Agatha, known as "Mother Wire," is draped in scavenged coats, a mass of Ethernet cables twisted like dreadlocks, and always smells faintly of mold and ozone. Her voice is a rasp of static, and her touch leaves a weird after-tingle. She builds the gear—hacked drones, retrofitted CCTV networks, haunted servers.
  
  Her domain is underground—literally. She has cameras in sewer grates, motion detectors in storm drains, and microphones in broken intercoms. She considers urban decay not a failure, but opportunity.
  
  She rarely speaks to anyone but Grin, who she treats like an unruly child she simultaneously resents and protects.
  ```

  - their shop in Brent is tiny, and contains a row of monitors which view the city 

#### What they know

- They have been tracking the Black Jacks on Camarilla orders the last few nights
  - something has been going on with them, normally you'd expect Kindred to pounce on someone, feed and then leave them, but tonight, they've been kind... hard to say, recruiting people? and then leading them off somewhere, a mixture of places, graveyards, abandoned factories, or even this one in a park
    - there's probably been a dozen or so sightings like this tonight?
    - they point at a monitor
    - dunno what's going on here - look, I don't recognise this guy *points to Father Caldus* on a monitor
    - there's quite a gathering going on here... i saw a couple of Black Jacks going in the trees here, plus at least half a dozen Kine...

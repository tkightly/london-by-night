# Father Caldus

## Basic Info

Father Caldus is a ghoul, belonging to [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md).

He leads Church of the Eternal Night at the forefront, leading the sermons and recruiting members

## Concept

A former seminary scholar turned zealot, Father Caldus serves as the mouthpiece and enforcer for the will of his domitor, Dr. Fairfax. He speaks with divine conviction, bending the minds of others with terrifying ease.

Though mortal, he has long outlived his natural life through regular infusions of Fairfax’s vitae. He is not only Fairfax’s agent in the mortal world but also the spiritual shepherd of a growing doomsday cult.

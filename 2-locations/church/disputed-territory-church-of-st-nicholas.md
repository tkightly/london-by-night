# Disputed Territory Church of St Nicholas

A deconsecrated, supposedly abandoned Victorian chapel used for cult meetings. Shadowy rites occur under stained glass windows blackened with ash. An ideal "public" front for a deeper sanctuary below.

| Main Entrance      | Heavy rusted iron gate; cracked stone steps leading up to the chapel.                       |
| Main Chapel Hall   | Victorian style with ash-blackened stained glass windows; wooden pews carved with symbols. |
| Altar Area        | Bare except for ritual candles and occult artifacts; concealed trapdoor beneath altar.     |
| Hidden Sanctuary   | Accessed via trapdoor; labyrinthine stone chambers with low lighting for secret rites.      |
| Graveyard          | Overgrown, crumbling gravestones surrounding the chapel; often used for discreet meetings. |
| Surrounding Woods  | Dense and shadowy; acts as natural barrier to visitors and prying eyes.                     |

| Tremere Chantry |  | ~1900 |
|   * entrace hall | Furnished with marble and mahogany| |
|   * reception lounge | Soft beige carpet, chesterfields, bookshelves | |

* The weather is chilly with drizzle
  * Upon arrival, they find:
    * the address is a largish red brick townhouse, unremarkable because the street seems to be full of them
    * the street outside is mildly busy with people hurrying with coats, otherwise mostly empty

* Characters will be welcomed by his ghoul, [Elias Crane](../3-characters/ghoul-elias-crane)
  * Mr Crane should be a bit snivelly, spend a lot of time looking at vampires wrists and being overly fawning
  * Julianna will be welcomed back?

* After all characters have arrived, [Gregory Shaw](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md) will shuffle in

### conversation

* thanks for coming
* the Camarilla is offering you the opportunity to prove your loyalty

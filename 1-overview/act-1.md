    Dear `name`

    The Primogen has requested your presence at the below address at 8 o'clock sharp on Wednesday 8th December.

  * Perhaps Julianna will have received a call from her Sire?

* The weather is chilly with drizzle
  * Upon arrival, they find:
    * the address is a largish red brick townhouse, unremarkable because the street seems to be full of them
    * the street outside is mildly busy with people hurrying with coats, otherwise mostly empty

* Characters will be welcomed by his ghoul, [Elias Crane](../3-characters/ghoul-elias-crane)
  * Julianna will be welcomed back?

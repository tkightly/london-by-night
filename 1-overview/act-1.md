| Each player character's haven | ~1900 |

* rouse the blood for waking

* players can describe their havens?

* Players will have received a note through the door of their haven during the day while they slept, requesting their presence at an address in Mayfair near Grosvenor Square.
    * Which is the Tremere Chantry to talk to [Seneschal Gregory Shaw ](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md)
    * note reads:

    ```
    Dear `name`,

    The Primogen has requested your presence at the below address at 8 o'clock sharp on Wednesday 8th December.

    My manservant Mr Crane will allow you in and take care of you. Please do not be alarmed by him.

    Do not discuss this matter with anyone prior to your arrival.

    Yours sincerely,

    Gregory Shaw, PhD
    ```

  * Perhaps Julianna will have received a call from her Sire?

# Scene 2

| location | notes | time |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| Tremere Chantry |  | ~1900 |
|   * entrace hall | Furnished with marble and mahogany| |
|   * reception lounge | Soft beige carpet, chesterfields, bookshelves | |

* The weather is chilly with drizzle
  * Upon arrival, they find:
    * the address is a largish red brick townhouse, unremarkable because the street seems to be full of them
    * the street outside is mildly busy with people hurrying with coats, otherwise mostly empty

* Characters will be welcomed by his ghoul, [Elias Crane](../3-characters/ghoul-elias-crane)
  * Mr Crane should be a bit snivelly, spend a lot of time looking at vampires wrists and being overly fawning
  * Julianna will be welcomed back?

* After all characters have arrived, [Gregory Shaw](../3-characters/seneschal-gregory-shaw.md) will shuffle in

### Conversation

* thanks for coming
* the Camarilla is offering you the opportunity to prove your loyalty
* of late, the Camarilla has received some disturbing signals
    * [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md), who you of course will remember is the Malkavian Primogen member, has reported receiving disturbing visions and dreams
        * such as dreams of whispers in the dark of `Cain's Angel`
        * and has reportedly received a dream of what he calls the `Red Beneath`, which he says is a vision of the Thames filling with blood
    * of course Malkavians are known to receive visions from time to time, many of them never coming to fruition... [Dr Lucille Fairfax](../3-characters/camarilla.md) has also never been particularly reliable
* but in this case, there has also been the matter of the ...uh... findings at the old [Hurdwick Underground Station](../2-locations/hurdwick-underground-station.md)
    * Our Nosferatu scouts were looking for Black Jack hideouts and they came across a rather nasty site of.. shall we say **worship**?
    * They were not overly concerned, certainly little in the underground system would spook a Nosferatu, but they did report it. Sadly, they were disturbed by human activity - probably homeless - at the site and did not get the opportunity for a good look around.
* this is where you come in. The station is only one stop south on the Northern line from Camden Town, close enough to Black Jack territory to cause trouble.
    * Which is why the Camarilla will not be sending any of the usual suspects to investigate... the Primogen has instructed me to find fresh blood for the task that will be obviously on Camarilla duty and will provide a level of plausible deniability
    * Of course i mention this to you only in the interest of full transparency
* Your task is to:
    * investigate the site
    * find out who is responsible, whether Black Jack or Camarilla 
    * ideally don't interact with the Black Jacks. If it can't be avoided, at least don't start a war...
    * above all... adhere to the Masquerade
    * report your findings directly to me. The primogen is anxious to find out if this is something to be concerned with or if they can get back to figuring out how to reclaim the stolen territory.

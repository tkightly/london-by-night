# The Plot

## Setup
* Ancient Lovecraftian entity wakes up in catacombs in Camden
* It calls out, a Malkavian elder dreams of the entity and seeks to find him
* During the search, the elder grows the cult to 10 members, consisting of homeless people, a couple of his ghouls and some neonates?
* After 1 month, the elder finds the tomb of the entity and begins to sacrifice cult members to it (for their vitae), but realises he needs to massively increase the population of the cult as the entity demands more and more blood
* The elder decides that the Anarch population would be easily swayed with promises of a powerful ally that could overthrough the Camarilla and begins talks to bring them on board

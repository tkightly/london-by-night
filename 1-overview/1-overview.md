# Campaign Overview
## Summary

**Name:** London by Night
**Setting:** London, December 1999
**System:** Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition
**Sessions:** 6-session limited campaign

## Chronicle Premise

It is London, December 1999. Over the previous decade, The Black Jacks fought against the Camarilla for independance in Camden, Islington and Tower Hamlets, and has barely held onto them under in a long stalement ever since.

In all other boroughs, The Kindred (vampire) population in London is under tight Camarilla control, led by a conservative, secretive Primogen Council.

Amid this, there are murmurings of a mortal cult holding late-night services in disused churches or abandoned Tube stations, The Black Jacks licking thier wounds to regroup and pick up where they left off, and of mysterious dreams.

Nevertheless, it is an exciting time to be in London - alive or dead; the advent of the new millenium is hostly anticipated by Kine (humans) and Kindred alike. Some hope for further liberation from the Camarilla, some hope to keep the status quo, and some hope for the end of the world

## Doom Clock: Cult Ascension Timeline

Unless stopped, the Church's plan will unfold across five phases:

1. **Whispers in the Shadows**
    - Cult activity is quiet but spreading. Mortals disappear. Strange symbols appear in alleyways.
2. **The First Bleeding**
    - Sacrifices begin. Cult draws attention from the Tremere and Nosferatu.
3. **The Shepherd’s Ascension**
    - Father Solomon gains spiritual power. Thin-Blood alchemists defect to the Church.
4. **Rapture**
    - A mass conversion of ghouls and Kindred. Public masquerade breaches begin.
5. **The Angel Rules**
    - The Angel is born—a Methuselah, or something worse. London falls into mystical theocracy.

## Player Involvement Options

Your coterie could be:
- **Camarilla Troubleshooters**: Assigned to quietly investigate and contain the cult.
- **Neonates with a Fragile Domain**: Their territory is threatened by cult encroachment.
- **Independent Agents**: Seeking power, recognition, or revenge—caught in the crossfire.
- **Outcasts**: Thin-Bloods, Caitiff, or Anarchs trying to survive by exploiting the chaos.
